# How to Contribute
## by oopsjpeg and Silvre

**Please read this __twice__ and then refer back to it when in doubt.**

- **DO NOT COMMIT TO MASTER.**
- If you'd like to contribute, make branches in the format of `<your username>/<task>`. For example, `oopsjpeg/implement-planets` or `Silvre/clean-common-module`.
- Attempt to optimize and clean your code. Check your code to make sure it works as intended. PR when you are finished.
- Do not remove unused imports, run a format, or generally attempt to clean the project if your PR is not solely for cleaning the project.
- If your code isn't basic, comment on it.
